    These two charts simultaneously show 1) the full spectrum of my skills and 2) how my proficiency in those skills have changed over time.  </p>
    <p>The first chart outlines a tree of my skills by category.  The size of each donut corresponds to my overall experience.  Hence, data science is my biggest "chunk" of knowledge while web development plays a much smaller role.  Statistics is a huge secondary skills but my knowledge of Machine Learning has been growing rapidly in the past two years.</p>
    <p>The second chart is a bit tricky.  The area between the two curves is the difference between that skill and the linear progression. [If you look closely, you can see the color outline matches the graph on the left.]  For example, take a look at  <code> data science > hybrid > elastic net, ridge, LASSO </code>.  There is basically a 'black hole' up. However, in 2013, I gained quite a bit of experience using these methods for feature selection.  Hence, those skill sets begin to close the gap beginning in 2013.  </p>
